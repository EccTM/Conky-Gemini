The cake is a lie.
War. War never changes.
I used to be an adventurer like you.
No gods or kings. Only man.
Nothing is true, everthing is permitted.
It's dangerous to go alone, take this!
Endure and survive.
Stay awhile, and listen!
But our Princess is in another castle!
Finish him!
A man chooses; a slave obeys.
For science. You monster.
Requiescat in pace.
It's super effective!
Do a barrel roll!
Stop right there, criminal scum!
Does this unit have a soul?
You have died of dysentery.
Send me out...with a bang.
I'm-a-Wario! I'ma gonna win!
FINISH HIM!
Steel wins battles. Gold  wins wars.
Welcome to the tutorial.
